## General Information
- This is a project that works with an Espressif 8266, takes measured data from an electrometer through an RS 485 to TTL converter and sends the data to an MQTT broker via WiFi. The project is tailored to work with EM300 registers. When using the same project, please change the registers for the meter you will use. The main purpose of the project is to constantly monitor the voltage of the phases in my home.


## Technologies Used
- C++ - version 17
- EasyEDA - version 6.4.18
- Autodesk Fusion360
